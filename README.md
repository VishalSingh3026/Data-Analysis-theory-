Data Unification Algorithm
In simple terms, a data unification algorithm is a method used to combine data from different sources into one clean, consistent format.

Another says: Full Name: Vishal Singh, City: New Delhi
A data unification algorithm helps match and merge these records so we know they're talking about the same person.
